Skeletal gimbal telescope mount, it is like a ball but less.


see: http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~tomc/Hobbies/Astronomy/ATM/SudiBall.pdf

the file "sudiball_template.scad" is 
OpenSCAD code to generate the family of objects I'm calling SudiBalls.

In the spirit of moving from the theoretical "you can design anything you want" 
to the more practical this, is the simplest one to build with everyday tools and materials 
here are vector drawings of my first Generic SudiBall. 
The important part here is the slots are just 90 degree cuts 
and cutting the entire profile at 90 degrees does not interfere 
with making the compound curve on the runners as a separate operation. 
This means the profiles may be cut with a laser, waterjet, CNC router, milling machine 
or by hand with a router or saw.

The compound curve on the runners of a two foot Sudiball with a 3/4" thick edge 
is under six thousandths of an inch, since the square edge is tangent to the sphere. 
This means just breaking the edge with sandpaper does a pretty good job of forming the desired curve.
Sticking adhesive back sandpaper to the ground ring and swirling it about is enough.

There are two sizes of vector drawing and two formats in the "vector_files" directory
Both are designed to use 3/4" material. So far, the 24" has been scaled in half and used with 3/8" material 
and to a third to use 1/4" material. 

The postscript can be printed on paper glued to whatever and cut out for quick tests 
the DXF may need some cleanup before feeding to a machine, i.e cross-hairs removed.

If you do something fun with these let me know I will set up a rouges gallery at some point.
