Sudiball

sSkeletal gimbal telescope mount, it is like a ball but less.


see: http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~tomc/Hobbies/Astronomy/ATM/SudiBall.pdf

the file "sudiball_template.scad" is 
OpenSCAD code to generate the family of objects I'm calling SudiBalls.

In the spirit of moving from the theoretical "you can design anything you want" 
to the more praticle this, is the simplist one to build with everyday tools and materials 
here are vector drawings of my first Generic SudiBall. 

The important part here is that the slots are just 90 degree cuts 
and cutting the entire profile at 90 degrees does not interfer with 
making the compound curve on the runners as a separate operation. 

This means the profiles may be cut with a laser, waterjet, CNC router, 
milling machine or, by hand with a saw.

The compound curve on the runners of a two foot Sudiball with a 3/4" thick
edge is under six thousanths of an inch, since the square edge is tangent
to the sphere. this means just breaking the edge with sandpaper does a pretty good job 
of forming the desired curve.

There are two sizes of vector drawing and two formats in the "vector_files" directory

Both are designed to use 3/4" material
so far, the 24" has been scaled in half and used with 3/8" material 
and to a third to use 1/4" material.
The postscript can be printed on paper glued to whatever and cut out for qiuck tests
the dxf may need some cleanup before feeding to a machine, i.e crosshairs removed.
 




If you do something fun with these let me know 
I will set up a rouges gallery at some point.
