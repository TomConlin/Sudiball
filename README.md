##Skeletal gimbal mount
###It's like a ball but less. 

To play with the models yourself you will need to
install a recent __stable__ version of OpenSCAD  
(the default version available to some older Linux systems  is broken)

I am focusing the software on easily built "standard" versions
where the planes intersect at right angles in the center of the ball. 

To facilitate visual experimentation prior to generating 2D vector
files, the scripts are divided into four modules.


__sudiconfig.scad__:  Where you will edit parameters (use any text editor) 
__sudiview.scad__:	 Load in OpenSCAD to see changes from parameters edited
__sudigen.scad__:	 Load in OpenSCAD to generate parts  
__sudilib.scad__:	Common routines used by sudigen & sudigen so you get what you see.

The file "[SudiBall Template](/sudiball_template.scad/)" file is 
OpenSCAD code to generate the family of objects I'm calling Sudiballs.

In the spirit of moving from the theoretical "you can design anything you want" 
to the more practical -- this is the simplest Sudiball to build with everyday tools and materials. 

CAD drawings and print files of my first generic Sudiball are in the [Vector Files](/vector_files/) directory. 
There are two sizes of vector drawing and four formats in the
Both are designed to use 3/4" material. 
So far, the 24" has been scaled in half and used with 3/8" material 
and to a third to use 1/4" material. 

The Postscript can be printed on paper glued to whatever and cut out for quick tests 
the DXF may need some cleanup before feeding to a machine, i.e cross-hairs removed.
The important part here is the slots are just 90 degree cuts 
and cutting the entire profile at 90 degrees does not interfere 
with making the compound curve on the runners as a separate operation. 
This means the profiles may be cut with a laser, waterjet, CNC router, milling machine 
or by hand with a router or saw.

The compound curve on the runners of a two foot Sudiball with a 3/4" thick edge 
is under six thousandths of an inch, since the square edge is tangent to the sphere. 
This means just breaking the edge with sandpaper does a pretty good job of forming the desired curve.
i.e. Sticking adhesive back sandpaper to the ground ring and swirling it about is enough.
