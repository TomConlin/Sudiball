There many unloved 4.5" (114mm) f8 Newtonion telescopes out there on rickety tripods.

Pushed each holliday season then closeted till the garage sale when the novelty of fiddeling with setting it up wears off.  

Now a days they get trumped up with "GoTo" moters for double extra fiddelness and a coresponding disapointment with 
what is charitably, a binocular scale view with poor eye relief and awkward handeling.  

We can't change the optics, but by mounting as a Sudiball we can eliminate fiddeling with the spindley tripod 
and improve the ergomomics for viewing (especially for child sized humans).
